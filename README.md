# car_washing_python_simulator
Simulate an environment in which cars enter a car washing station with a defined number of washing machines and spend a given number of minutes being washed, 
after which it leaves and makes the washing machine available for the next car. Cars enter the car wash after a randomly generated period and the simulation 
runs until a specified condition is met.
